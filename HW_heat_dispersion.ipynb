    "In this problem, we will learn about a simple algorithm for numerically simulating the spread of heat through a material. We will want to use vectorization to write an efficient algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we have a rectangular piece of steel. For now, let's treat this piece of steel as a 5x5 grid - we are only able to measure the average temperature of each of these 25 grid regions. Let's assume that steel starts off at a uniform 0-degrees. Thus, our temperature readout for each of its grid positions is:\n",

    "```\n",

    "Now, we will clamp hot contacts, which are always at a constant 100-degrees, along the outer edges of the steel. Upon clamping these contacts, our temperature readout at time-0 becomes:\n",

    "                               100    0     0     0    100\n",

    "\n",
    "Moving forward, we want to describe, numerically, how the heat from the contacts will spread through the material as time carries on. The heat equation is a partial differential equation that describes the flow of heat through space and time. In the following equation, the function $u(x, y, t)$ describes how much heat resides at the location $(x, y)$ at time $t$:\n",

    "Do not worry if you have no clue what a partial differential equation is! You do not need to know anything about the heat equation, we are simply providing some background here. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this equation ultimately says is that heat will spread such that a point will take on the average amount of heat among its neighboring points. Numerically, we can write this out as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "u^{(t)}_{ij} = \\frac{u^{(t-1)}_{i+1,j} + u^{(t-1)}_{i-1,j} + u^{(t-1)}_{i,j+1} + u^{(t-1)}_{i,j-1}}{4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, $u^{(t)}_{ij}$ is the heat at grid-location $(i, j)$ at time-step $t$. It's value is given by the average of the heat of all four of its neighboring grid positions from time-step $t-1$. See that the right side of the equation averages the heat from above, below, left-of, and right-of $(i, j)$, at time-step $t-1$. This means of evolving the heat through our gridded material is known as the *finite difference method*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's using the finite difference method to figure out what the distribution of heat looks like throughout our steel square at time-step 1. Keep in mind that we need not update any of the outer-edges of the steel - those positions are held at a fixed heat. We'll start at the upper-left corner and get\n",

    "\n",
    "Repeating this process again will produce the heat distribution at timestep-2, and so on. After many iterations, we see the entire region becomes 100 degrees. This is because the heat from the edges flows inward until everything is the same temperature. This stabilized distribution of heat is known as the *steady state*. If we change the boundary conditions, i.e. change what we clamp to the edges of our steel, we will observe different steady states.\n"
